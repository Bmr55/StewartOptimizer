# Active simulator

The simulator uses the same internal layout and `evaluatePose` function as the
optimizer. Lengths are millimetres, pose rotations and `betaAngles` are radians,
and `servoRangeRad` is radians. Downloaded layouts convert the servo range to
degrees through the shared layout export contract.

## Controller boundary

`createSimulatorController()` in `src/simulator/controller.js` owns a copy of the
active layout. `loadLayout(layout, { source, options })` resets pose state and
checks home. `source` identifies a candidate, import, or editable copy; candidate
sources carry `candidateId`. The controller never edits the retained optimizer
result. `getReferenceLayout()` returns another independent copy for optimizer
reference input or JSON transfer.

`requestPose(pose, { source })` always records six finite requested coordinates
and calls `evaluatePose` with `recordLegData: true`. `getState()` returns the
requested pose, evaluator `assessment`, last valid `accepted` pose, and
`acceptedAssessment`. A failed request keeps its leg-specific diagnostics but
does not change `accepted`; if home fails, `accepted` remains `null`. Rendering
uses the accepted pose only. `setOptions(patch)` reevaluates both the accepted
pose and current request. `subscribe(listener)` provides a snapshot immediately
and after every change; its returned function unsubscribes. Geometry controls
and diagnostics should use these calls rather than duplicating the evaluator.

`setAnimation(pattern, playing, settings)` and `tick(deltaSeconds, settings)`
support wobble, ping-pong, rotation, tilt, and helical motion. An invalid
animation frame pauses playback and leaves its request and failure visible.
Markers and bounded accepted-position traces are controlled by `setMarkers`,
`setTraces`, and `clearTrace`.
